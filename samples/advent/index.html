		<p>Unreal Engine 2 Modification: 2D Crowd System</p>

		<p class="text">
		A 2D Crowd System for rendering large crowds in the distance which exhibit designer-specified, real-time behaviors such as  
		battling, path-following, and socializing.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Details</h2>
		
		<p class="text">
		The purpose of this project was to add functionality to the Unreal Editor that afforded designers the ability to place large 
		crowds of actors in the distance, adjust a number of settings to dictate their behavior, and allow an unscripted scene to
		unfold which emulated natural behavior as closely as possible.  The types of behavior supported were battling, socializing,
		and path-following.
		</p>
		<p class="text">
		What follows are in-Editor screenshots depicting a variety of viewports from within the Unreal Editor which demonstrate how 
		such crowds could be placed into the 3D world, and the resultant scenes produced.  Bear in mind that all art is
		programmer-generated, intended to showcase the capabilities of the new feature.  In no way are any of the screenshots
		representative of a polished scene intended for use in-game.
		</p>
		<!-- <p class="textbottom"> -->
		<p class="text">
		While the following scenes obviously do not stand up to scrutiny from such a close distance, the requirements for this feature 
		called for scenes that take place far off in the background (such as in a distant valley as seen from a mountain cliff).  At 
		such distances, the difference between sprite-based and model-based characters is unlikely to be discernable.

				The animation textures serve as placeholders to represent the individual crowds themselves, although their positions
				are irrelevant.  The M icon is the crowd manager object that represents this particular scene, while the P icons are
				the path nodes, which can be associated with either crowd.  Their order is determined by a value which is also 
				designer-specified.

				indicate the initial facing direction of crowd members, which can also be random or center-facing.  Social crowds could 
				be related to other social crowds as friends, in which case members could exchange and associate with one other.  As 
				before, all settings were adjustable.

				<b>An extreme example of two 5000-member crowds doing battle with projectiles and melee attacks to demonstrate the
				capabilities of the crowd system.</b>  The battling crowd system was the most complex, and essentially allowed for 
				massive, real-time battles between factions in what resembles an RPG-style confrontation.  Numerous settings could be 
				specified in order to effect a specific outcome, including member velocity, hit points, strength, attack durations and 
				delays, reload times, etc.  This resulted in true, unique battles in real time with the potential for unpredictable 
				results if so desired.  A natural variance was built in to every action, a setting which could also be adjusted by the 
				designer.  Notably, the above scene ran well above the target frame rate on the Xbox.
