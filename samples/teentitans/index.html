		<h1>Teen Titans</h1>
	
		<p>Arcade-Style Minigames</p>

		<p class="text">
		A pair of minigames for the multi-platform console game <i>Teen Titans</i> which are homages to the early arcade classics
		<i>Pong</i> and <i>Space Invaders</i>.  The player must complete each game in order to advance to the final boss battle.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Details</h2>
		
		<p class="text">
		The purpose of this project was to add arcade-style minigames to the gameflow, both as an opportunity to briefly introduce a 
		new game mechanic into the somewhat repetitive beat 'em up gameplay, and to accentuate the story element revealing that the
		Teen Titans are actually trapped inside a video game.
		</p>
		<p class="text">
		The minigames were initially scrapped by the development team due to time constraints, at which point I was asked by Majesco
		to visit the developer, integrate into the team and workflow, and become acquainted with their proprietary engine and toolset
		as quickly as possible in order to enable remote development for the remainder of the project.
		</p>
		<p class="text">
		Since lack of personnel was the reason cited for cancelling the minigames in the first place, development was to proceed with
		minimal time commitment from the existing team members.  I was therefore called upon to implement almost all aspects of both
		minigames, including game mechanics, physics, AI, visual and audio effects, interface, etc.  What resulted is two complete
		minigames produced single-handedly by myself, utilizing almost entirely pre-existing assets.
		</p>
		<p class="text">
		The following is a video medley of the two minigames as they appeared in the release version of <i>Teen Titans</i>.
